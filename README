README

Remap is an addon for the Orbiter Space Flight Simulator.

It defines additional key mappings for direct control of the thrusters
of the currently selected vessel.

The original purpose for this addon was to enable direct control of the
translation thrusters without having to switch betweenthe Translation and
the Rotation Modes.

However, the code was written in a fairly generic manner in order to enable
any standard thruster group to be controlled, which includes the Rotation Mode
thrusters, as well as the Main and Retro engine thrusters.

By default the additional key mappings are as follows:

Alt   + NUM4 / NUM6  Engage left/right translation thrusters.
Alt   + NUM9 / NUM3  Engage up/down translation thrusters.
Alt   + NUM8 / NUM2  Engage forward/back translation thrusters.

Shift + NUM4 / NUM6  Engage bank left/right rotation thrusters.
Shift + NUM2 / NUM8  Engage pitch up/down rotation thrusters.
Shift + NUM1 / NUM3  Engage yaw left/right rotation thrusters.

The NumLock key has to be ON for these to work.

In combination with Ctrl, the thrusters are engaged at 10% maximum thrust
for fine control.

INSTALL

1. Ensure PLATFORMSDK and ORBITER paths are set correctly in the makefile.
2. Run 'nmake all' inside the Remap directory to compile the addon.
3. Run 'nmake install' inside the Remap directory to install the addon.
4. Enable the addon in the Orbiter.
5. Share and enjoy.

The key mappings can be customized by modifing the control array in the
remap.hpp file.
